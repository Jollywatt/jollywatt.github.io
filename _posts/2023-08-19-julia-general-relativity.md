Four years after I took general relativity, my professor asked me to send him an old animation I had made during his course showing ‚Äúparallel transport of vectors around a line of latitude on the sphere‚Äù ‚Äî except I wasn‚Äôt the one who had made it (though I was flattered that he had thought so!)
Even so, I didn‚Äôt want to respond empty handed‚Ä¶

The tool I reached for was Julia. To my delight, the whole thing was rather simple to make.
This was the humble result:

I remember thinking that numerically computing geodesics or simulating parallel transport were frightfully involved and required a mess of technical computing. Not so.
If you have similar impression, read on.


## Step 0: Maps between manifolds

<!-- When deciding how to deal with manifolds and maps between them with a computer, there were two main directions to go: represent them symbolically and use a CAS to do all the algebra; or represent them numerically.

I chose to stick with numbers. This allows us to 
 -->
The very first task is to decide how to represent the main mathematical objects.
Manifolds and homomorphisms between them can feel complicated and abstract, but with a choice of coordinates, they‚Äôre just vectors and functions vectors to vectors.

Here‚Äôs an embedding $$f: ùïä^2 ‚Üí ‚Ñù^3$$ of a sphere into 3D space using the usual spherical coordinates $$(Œ∏, œÜ)$$, as a Julia function:

```julia
f((Œ∏, œÜ)) = [
  sin(Œ∏)cos(œÜ),
  sin(Œ∏)sin(œÜ),
  cos(Œ∏),
]
```

Notice this has one vector argument which is de-structured into two scalars.

```julia
julia> f([œÄ/2, 0]) # meridian point on the equator
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
 6.123233995736766e-17
```

You could imagine doing something fancier and more object-oriented, like defining a `Manifold` in terms of charts and transition functions. Don‚Äôt. Dead simple is good.

## Step 1: Automatic differentiation

Differential geometry has lots of ‚Äò$$‚àÇ$$‚Äôs.
We want to have derivatives of homomorphisms such as `f` be computed _automatically_.
There are many approaches to doing this with Julia, ranging from using [`Symbolics.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/Symbolics) for algebraic differentiation to using [`Zygote.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/Zygote) and friends to differentiate code.

In our case, we‚Äôre not doing anything fancy, just making vectors from mathematical functions line `sin`, so all we‚Äôll need are dual numbers.

### Dual numbers

If you extend the reals by adding an element $$Œµ ‚â† 0$$ satisfying $$Œµ^2 = 0$$, then you can get derivative information for free when you evaluate a function $$f$$ with a $$+Œµ$$, since

$$
f(x + Œµ) = f(x) + Œµ f'(x)
.$$

The real part is the value, and the derivative is the $$Œµ$$-part, which we denote with $$‚ü®\quad‚ü©_Œµ$$.

$$
f'(x) = ‚ü®f(x + Œµ)‚ü©_Œµ = \frac{f(x + Œµ) - f(x)}{Œµ}
$$

To do this in Julia, the [`TaylorSeries.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/TaylorSeries) package is fine. 
Here‚Äôs $$\sin(x + Œµ)$$ at $$x = œÄ/3$$‚Ä¶

```julia
julia> using TaylorSeries

julia> sin(Taylor1([œÄ/3, 1]))
 0.8660254037844386 + 0.5000000000000001 t + ùí™(t¬≤)

julia> ans[1] # get the Œµ-part
0.5000000000000001

julia> ans == cos(œÄ/3)
true
```

### Computing Jacobians

This trick works for functions of vectors, too.
We simply add $$+Œµ$$ to the component we want to differentiate with respect to:

$$
‚àÇ_Œº f(\vec x) = \bigg‚ü® f\left(\begin{bmatrix}x^1 \\ \vdots \\ x^Œº + Œµ \\ \vdots \\ x^n \end{bmatrix}\right) \bigg‚ü©_Œµ
$$

For a function $$f : ‚Ñù^m ‚Üí ‚Ñù^n$$, we have a matrix of derivatives (a Jacobian).

$$
\mqty[
‚àÇ_Œº f^ŒΩ(\vec x)
]_{ŒºŒΩ} =
\mqty[
‚àÇ_1 \vec f(\vec x) \\
\vdots \\
‚àÇ_n \vec f(\vec x)
] =
\mqty[
‚àÇ_1 f^1(\vec x) & \cdots & ‚àÇ_1 f^m(\vec x) \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
‚àÇ_n f^1(\vec x) & \cdots & ‚àÇ_n f^m(\vec x)
]
$$


We want to be able to compute the whole Jacobian matrix with the first dimension (columns) running along the first index that appears, $$Œº$$, and the second dimension (rows) along the second index, $$ŒΩ$$.

$$
\mqty[
\bigg‚ü®f^1\qty(\mqty[x^1 + Œµ\\\vdots\\x^n])\bigg‚ü©_Œµ & \cdots & \bigg‚ü®f^m\qty(\mqty[x^1 + Œµ\\\vdots\\x^n])\bigg‚ü©_Œµ \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\bigg‚ü®f^1\qty(\mqty[x^1\\\vdots\\x^n + Œµ])\bigg‚ü©_Œµ & \cdots & \bigg‚ü®f^m\qty(\mqty[x^1\\\vdots\\x^n + Œµ])\bigg‚ü©_Œµ \\
]
$$

Here‚Äôs a literal Julia implementation:

```julia
"""
Jacobian matrix of a vector-to-vector function.
"""
function ‚àÇ(f, x)
  I = eachindex(x)
  derivs = [f([Taylor1([x[i], i == j]) for i ‚àà I]) for j ‚àà I]
  matrix = stack(derivs, dims=1) # stack the vectors into rows of a matrix
  getindex.(matrix, 1) # take Œµ-part of each component
end
```

Let‚Äôs test it on our sphere embedding map `f` by comparing it to the analytic Jacobian.

```julia
julia> ‚àÇf((Œ∏, œÜ)) = [
           +cos(Œ∏)cos(œÜ) +cos(Œ∏)sin(œÜ) -sin(Œ∏)
           -sin(Œ∏)sin(œÜ) +sin(Œ∏)cos(œÜ)       0
       ];

julia> all(‚àÇ(f, x) ‚âà ‚àÇf(x) for x in eachcol(rand(2,100)))
true
```
So far so good.

### Higher order derivatives

But what about second order derivatives?

Luckily, since this is Julia, `TaylorSeries.jl` is generic and lets you construct Taylor series whose coefficients are themselves Taylor series.

This means our implementation for `‚àÇ` works even on functions which call `‚àÇ`, lettings us compute higher order derivatives in the obvious way.
For example, $$‚àÇ_Œº ‚àÇ_ŒΩ f^Œª(\vec x)$$ is written as:

```julia
‚àÇ‚àÇf(x) = ‚àÇ(x‚Ä≤ -> ‚àÇ(f, x‚Ä≤), x)
```

Notice that this produces a three dimensional array, since $$‚àÇ_Œº ‚àÇ_ŒΩ f^Œª(\vec x)$$ has three free indices.

```julia
julia> ‚àÇ‚àÇf([1,2])
2√ó2√ó3 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
  0.350175  -0.491295
 -0.491295   0.350175

[:, :, 2] =
 -0.765147  -0.224845
 -0.224845  -0.765147

[:, :, 3] =
 -0.540302  -0.0
 -0.0       -0.0
```

We can get a particular component with normal multidimensional indexing, like `‚àÇ‚àÇf(x)[Œº,ŒΩ,Œª]`.
(This shows how `‚àÇ` diverges slightly from other Jacobian implementations: it doesn‚Äôt flatten extra dimensions.)


## Step 2: Metrics and Christoffel symbols

To compute geodesics on things like spheres or tori, we need the metric $$g_{ŒºŒΩ}$$ and Christoffel symbols $$Œì^Œª{}_{ŒºŒΩ}$$.


### Induced metrics

If we already have a parametric description of the surface in $$‚Ñù^n$$, such as our sphere embedding $$f$$, then we should be able to get the surface metric induced by the ambient Euclidean metric, $$Œ∑ = \operatorname{diag}(1, \dots, 1)$$.
Specifically, we need pullback of $$Œ∑$$ by $$f$$.

$$
g \coloneqq f^*Œ∑
$$

This is the same as

$$
g(\vec u, \vec v) = Œ∑(f_*\vec u, f_*\vec v)
$$

where $$f_*$$ is the pushforward ‚Äî nothing but the Jacobian, given coordinates:

$$
(f_* \vec u )^ŒΩ\big|_{\vec x} = ‚àÇ_Œº f^ŒΩ(\vec x) \, u^Œº
$$

Therefore, the component form of $$g(\vec u, \vec v)$$ is

$$
\begin{align*}
g_{ŒºŒΩ} u^Œº v^ŒΩ &= Œ∑_{œÅœÉ} \, ‚àÇ_Œº f^œÅ u^Œº \, ‚àÇ_ŒΩ f^œÉ u^œÅ \\
g_{ŒºŒΩ} &= ‚àÇ_œÅ f^Œº \, Œ∑_{ŒºŒΩ} \, ‚àÇ_œÉ f^ŒΩ \\
\end{align*}
$$

Really, this is matrix-matrix multiplication.

$$
g = f_* Œ∑ (f_*)^\intercal = f_* (f_*)^\intercal
$$

The Julia translation is just as pretty:

```julia
g(x) = let ‚àÇf = ‚àÇ(f, x)
  ‚àÇf*‚àÇf'
end
```

Let‚Äôs sanity check it again:

```julia
julia> g_sphere((Œ∏, œï)) = [
           1        0
           0 sin(Œ∏)^2
       ];

julia> all(g(x) ‚âà g_sphere(x) for x in eachcol(rand(2, 100)))
true
```

### Christoffel symbols

Now comes the interesting maths.
We‚Äôll need the Christoffel symbols, which are

$$
Œì^Œª{}_{ŒºŒΩ} = \frac12g^{ŒªœÉ}\qty(\partial_Œº g_{œÉŒΩ} + \partial_ŒΩ g_{œÉŒº} - \partial_œÉ g_{ŒºŒΩ})
.$$

Implementing this in Julia is just a matter of summing over all the right components.
A nice way of doing this is to use an Einstein summation package like [`TensorOperations.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/TensorOperations) which provides a macro for enabling summation convention.

```julia
using TensorOperations

function Œì(g, x)
  ‚àÇg = ‚àÇ(g, x)
  @tensor Œì[Œª,Œº,ŒΩ] := 2\inv(g(x))[Œª,œÉ]*(‚àÇg[Œº,œÉ,ŒΩ] + ‚àÇg[ŒΩ,œÉ,Œº] - ‚àÇg[œÉ,Œº,ŒΩ])
end
```

Within the `@tensor` expression, any Julia identifier inside `[ ]` is treated as an index, whose range is automatically computed at runtime, with repeated indices implicitly summed.
The `:=` means a new array is created.

To test it out and check that the basic symmetry $$Œì^Œª{}_{ŒºŒΩ} = Œì^Œª{}_{ŒΩŒº}$$ holds:

```julia
julia> Œì(g, [1,2])
2√ó2√ó2 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.642093

[:, :, 2] =
 0.0       -0.454649
 0.642093   0.0

julia> ans == permutedims(ans, (1, 3, 2))
true
```

## Step 3: Geodesics

Now we get to the cool stuff ‚Äî geodesics.

A geodesic is a curve $$\vec x(t)$$ satisfying

$$
\dot x^Œº(t) ‚àá_Œº \dot x^Œª(t) = 0
,$$

that is, the velocity vector $$\dot x$$ is covariantly constant along the direction it points.
Unpacking the covariant derivative, this becomes:

$$
\dot x^Œº(t) ‚àÇ_Œº \dot x^Œª(t) + \dot x^Œº(t) Œì^Œª{}_{ŒºŒΩ} \big|_{\vec x(t)} \dot x^ŒΩ(t) = 0
$$

Simplifying using the chain rule $$\frac{\dd x^Œº}{\dd t}\frac{‚àÇ\dot{x}^Œª}{‚àÇx^Œº} = \ddot x^Œª$$ and leaving arguments implicit:

$$
\ddot x^Œª = -Œì^Œª{}_{ŒºŒΩ} \dot x^Œº \dot x^ŒΩ
$$

This is a system of second order ordinary differential equations.
Julia has good support for numerically solving ODEs.
We will use [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/DifferentialEquations).
To use it, we must put the ODE into standard form, $$y'' = f(y', y, t)$$.

$$
\ddot{\vec{x}} = f_\text{geodesic}(\dot{\vec{x}}, \vec{x}, t)
$$

The Julia package expects two extra arguments: the first argument is the array to write the derivatives of $$\ddot{\vec{x}}$$ into (optional, but leads to better performance); the other is a parameter before $$t$$ to pass in any other data, like the metric.

```julia
function geodesic!(xÃà, xÃá, x, g, t)
  @tensor xÃà[Œª] = -Œì(g, x)[Œª,Œº,ŒΩ]*xÃá[Œº]*xÃá[ŒΩ]
end
```

Here‚Äôs an example of solving it with some initial data.
Take our sphere again, and imagine launching a particle eastward along the equator, $$Œ∏ = œÄ/2$$.

```julia
julia> using DifferentialEquations

julia> xÃá0 = [0., 1.]; x0 = [œÄ/2, 0.]; tspan = (0, 10);

julia> prob = SecondOrderODEProblem(geodesic!, xÃá0, x0, tspan, g)
ODEProblem with uType ArrayPartition{Float64, Tuple{Vector{Float64}, Vector{Float64}}} and tType Int64. In-place: true
timespan: (0, 10)
u0: ([0.0, 1.0], [1.5707963267948966, 0.0])

julia> sol = solve(prob);
```

The solution object `sol` is matrix-like, with the form

$$
\mqty[
\dot{\vec x}(t_1) & \cdots & \dot{\vec x}(t_n) \\
\vec x(t_1) & \cdots & \vec x(t_n) \\
]
,$$

so we can extract just $$\vec x(t)$$ by taking the bottom two rows:
```julia
julia> sol[3:4,:]
2√ó6 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.5708  1.5708      1.5708     1.5708    1.5708    1.5708
 0.0     0.00141306  0.0155436  0.156849  1.56991  10.0
```

We can see that our geodesic curve stays at the equator $$Œ∏ = œÄ/2$$ and orbits around with $$œÜ$$ increasing at one radian per unit time.

Boring, but correct!
