## Conservation of momentum

Momentum is always conserved.
If $$𝒑_1$$ and $$𝒑_2$$ are the initial momentum vectors of the two incident bodies, then

$$ 𝒑_1 + 𝒑_2 = 𝒑'_1 + 𝒑'_2 $$

where $$'$$ indicates the value after the collision.

We can more easily visualise this constraint by drawing the momenta tip-to-tail, connecting to the same total momentum before and after the collision:
