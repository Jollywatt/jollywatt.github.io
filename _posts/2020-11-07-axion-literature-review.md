Literature review supervised by Dr. Jenni Adams at the University of Canterbury.

I wanted to learn more about particle physics after my Bachelor’s, so a year of part-time study culminated in this literature review.
I learned basic classical (and a little quantum) field theory, and read about the “strong $$CP$$ problem” of quantum chromodynamics and its solution via “axions”.
The report is aimed at the mathematically-inclined graduate who is uninitiated in particle physics.
